To do: 
In generateEggChamberSummaryTable
- Generate summary statistics per condition, and save as text file.
- Include table and summary stats for egg chambers of desired stages.

- in scatterPlotMetricBySample
Exclude egg chamber stages but plot by sample?

- in scatterPlotMetricBySample and scatterPlotMetricByEggChamber
overlay egg chamber mean over scatter plot.
Color code egg chamber by stage? By condition? color symbols, add alpha

- add function to save plot, maybe along w some metadata.

New functions:
- plots Histogram plot for nuclei metrics by egg chamber, by sample.

- normalize metrics by z? By DAPI signal?

- Cluster metrics.
Figure out when adding clusters whether we want a second table for the cluster stats and then integrate mean cluster stats to the nuclei table.

- Same for plotting - should we make function by nucleus or by cluster.


* notes on analysis
- Judging by DAPI, median/wholeImgCorr seems the metric that gives the least CV. Not by a ton vs mean. The omg correction definitely helps though.
- unclear how EC stage and 
Plot metric a vs metric b
