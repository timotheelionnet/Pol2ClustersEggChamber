To do: 
In generateEggChamberSummaryTable
- Generate summary statistics per condition, and save as text file.
- Include table and summary stats for egg chambers of desired stages.

- in scatterPlotMetricBySample
Exclude egg chamber stages but plot by sample?

- in scatterPlotMetricBySample and scatterPlotMetricByEggChamber
overlay egg chamber mean over scatter plot.
Color code egg chamber by stage? By condition? color symbols, add alpha

- add function to save plot, maybe along w some metadata.

- nucleolus segmentation and background. What is the current status? Check how to integrate that with the nuclei table.

- Fiji: add log file with time stamps and list of parameters used for each of the macros. 

Documentation:
- data org: add screen cap.
- nuclei segmentation walk through.
- cluster detection walk through.

New functions:
- Histogram plot for nuclei metrics by egg chamber, by sample.

- plot metric a vs metric b. Use for z, egg chamber stage, sample.

- normalize metrics by z? By DAPI signal?

- Cluster metrics.
Figure out when adding clusters whether we want a second table for the cluster stats and then integrate mean cluster stats to the nuclei table.
This will be needed if we want background correction for the clusters.

- Same for plotting - should we make function by nucleus or by cluster.

- general thought on plotting functions: we will likely need to easily exclude samples/egg chambers if wonky, egg chamber stages etc; options what feature to color code, what colors to use. Probably best to have name pair arguments structure of optional things in order to use the existing Matlab structure.

* notes on analysis
- Judging by DAPI, median/wholeImgCorr seems the metric that gives the least CV. Not by a ton vs mean. The omg correction definitely helps though.

- unclear how EC stage, z impact metrics, need function to plot a vs b to figure that out.

- also maybe have a volume cutoff and/or DAPI std to be able to exclude poorly segmented nuclei if we think they will be an issue.
