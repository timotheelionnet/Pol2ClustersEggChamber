To do:
*********************************
** Curent Functions small updates 
In generateEggChamberSummaryTable
 -Generate summary statistics per condition, and save as text file.
 -Include table and summary stats for egg chambers of desired stages.

- in scatterPlotMetricBySample: Exclude egg chamber stages but plot by sample?

- in scatterPlotMetricBySample and scatterPlotMetricByEggChamber
  -overlay egg chamber mean over scatter plot.
  -Color code egg chamber by stage? By condition? color symbols, add alpha

- add function to save plot, maybe along w some metadata.

- Fiji: add log file with time stamps and list of parameters used for each of the macros. 

*********************************
** Architecture questions

- nucleolus segmentation and background. What is the current status? Check how to integrate that with the nuclei table.

- how to save analyses w different parameters w/o overwriting?

- general thought on plotting functions: we will likely need to easily exclude samples/egg chambers if wonky, egg chamber stages etc; options what feature to color code, what colors to use. Probably best to have name pair arguments structure of optional things in order to use the existing Matlab structure.

- Cluster metrics: Figure out when adding clusters whether we want a second table for the cluster stats and then integrate mean cluster stats to the nuclei table.
This will be needed if we want background correction for the clusters.

- Same for plotting - should we make function by nucleus or by cluster.

*********************************
** Documentation:
- data org: add screen cap.
- nuclei segmentation walk through.
- cluster detection walk through.

*********************************
** New functions:
- Histogram plot for nuclei metrics by egg chamber, by sample.
- plot metric a vs metric b. Use for z, egg chamber stage, sample.
- normalize metrics by z? By DAPI signal?

*********************************
** notes on analysis
- Judging by DAPI, median/wholeImgCorr seems the metric that gives the least CV. Not by a ton vs mean. The omg correction definitely helps though.
- unclear how EC stage, z impact metrics, need function to plot a vs b to figure that out.
- also maybe have a volume cutoff and/or DAPI std to be able to exclude poorly segmented nuclei if we think they will be an issue.

*********************************
** Fiji bugs
nucleoliInt seems empty

*********************************
For the scatter by eggChamber function:
- use https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/inputparser.html to parse input.
Parameters: 
eggChamberStagesToInclude, 
samplesToInclude, 
colorCode (sample; eggChamber; condition; eggChamberStage; any variable really - check how to build the name intuitively. Maybe some keywords or full variable name), 
colorMap (include cBrewer options), 
alpha, 
addMeanAndErrorBar
Different grouping spacing modes?
Should I trim the data table as an easier way to process the data plotting?

- for the cluster data import
Some metrics are nuclei-centric: 
	nucleoliInt
	plasmInt (single row)
Others are clusters centric:
	clustInt_raw
	clustInt_plasmCorr

Import nuclei-centric metrics in global table.
Generate a cluster table to load cluster stats. 
Need to include the file, egg chamber, nucleus ID for each cluster to easily match with the nucleus-centric data. 
Copy-paste the nucleus wide intensity stats?
