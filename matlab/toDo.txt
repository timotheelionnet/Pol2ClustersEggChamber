To do:
*********************************
Immediate fixes:
X change eggChamber -> "sampleROI" in suffixes. 
X Change condIdx to cond_Idx. Same for sampleIdx, eggChamberID, eggChamberStage, nucLabel, clustLabel. stdClustVolume
x make sure that variables follow the pattern: Channel string: C1 to C5 <prefix><channelString>_<metricName>_<suffix>
- bg subtraction functions, check that suffixes are the following: 
- wholeImgSubtracted
- sampleROISubtracted
- plasmSubtracted
- nucleoliSubtracted
- build wiki/benchling to document metric names and meanings.

- what is the best background to use? Seems like geometric mean of min and mode might be the best (or just reg mean?)
For eggchamber background correction, 
- fix variable reordering

- addNucStatsToClustTable -> modify to make work for fullNucT AND nucT.
- same for addAverageClusterStatsToNucTable -> modify to copy paste all cluster metrics from cluster table to FullNucT
x change numClusters to nucNumCLusters in addAverageClusterStatsToNucTable. Add numCluster to list of accepted variables.
- check for order of operations when merging cluster metrics and background correcting metrics. prob need to background correct everything first. Write one larger function that runs all those data processing steps in order to avoid issues: bg-correct nuclei, bg-correct clusters, merge clusters into nuc table, merge nuc data into cluster table. End up w 2 giant data tables.
- check if methods are robust for datasets without clusters. (Clusters is an empty table and make all functions do nothing when that's the case).
- generate a method which computes the z score of each nucleus along all of the metrics, by eggchamber stage. Same for cluster table.
- viz as heat map - make sure that the ticks make it easy to go to each nucleus to check for problem ones. Cluster by metrics since so many will be redundant. Build list of variables that are metrics vs status/ID labels.

- for QC of nuclei. Goal: identify which nuclei are poorly segmented based on metrics.
Perform modified z-score of nuclear metrics (by egg chamber stage).
Find file names, nuclei indices of nuclei that are outliers based on different metrics.
Look at nuclei visually. Assay whether metrics reflect segmentation performance.
Vice versa -> id nuclei that are poorly segmented. 
- check for nuclei with extreme z-scores for the cluster metrics as possible indications of issues.
- u-map or t-sne of nuclei metrics to ID outliers?


- QC clustering performance. Do clusters look legit?
Take nuclei at random. Check clustering performance. 
If clustering isn't good enough, check how to redo analysis without overwriting existing results? Carbon copy csvs to another output folder that reproduces that architecture of the original one?

- rewrite/update a table streamlining function? Probably makes sense to streamline once at the end? Or make sure streamlining works regardless of when we call it.

- u-map or t-sne of nuclei metrics to ID outliers?

- update the Fiji sampleROI-wise output files to not call them eggChamber. Update the file naming expected by Matlab.

*********************************
** Current Functions small updates 
In generateEggChamberSummaryTable
 - Generate summary statistics per condition, and save as text file.
 - Include table and summary stats for egg chambers of desired stages. Also include clusters if the Data is there.

- in scatterPlotMetricBySample: Exclude egg chamber stages but plot by sample?

- in scatterPlotMetricBySample and scatterPlotMetricByEggChamber
  -overlay egg chamber mean over scatter plot.
  -Color code egg chamber by stage? By condition? color symbols, add alpha

- add function to save plot, maybe along w some metadata.

- Fiji: add log file with time stamps and list of parameters used for each of the macros. 

X From Feiyue: A few minor notes: 1. would be great if you can make it workable with .nd2 but may not be necessary since I would need to run the batch.detrended script first any way, I believe the output of that is .tif? so if the script is a step 2, it may be fine as it is; 2. Gotta make sure that the egg chambers are absolutely not on top of each other (which is true to most images but there could be exceptions); 3. I wonder if there's a way to prevent the script from proceeding when no ROI is added - in the majority of cases, I will likely only select one egg chamber per image. If I somehow forgot to hit "CMD+t" for one image in the middle of the selection, I might need to start all over?

*********************************
** Architecture questions

x nucleolus segmentation and background. What is the current status? Check how to integrate that with the nuclei table.

- how to save analyses w different parameters w/o overwriting?

x Cluster metrics: Figure out when adding clusters whether we want a second table for the cluster stats and then integrate mean cluster stats to the nuclei table.
This will be needed if we want background correction for the clusters.

x Same for plotting - should we make function by nucleus or by cluster. 

*********************************
** robustness
X rename existing methods so it's unambiguous they apply to nuclei metrics.
X Make sure all operations are performed on both t and fullT to maintain consistency.
X Make sure that methods to subtract background etc check for pre-exisitng runs (do not subtract twice). Also that they can be run at any point, e.g. before or after the plasmInt and the nucleoliInt have been added.
X make table construction and methods modular whether or not one wants to quantify clusters.
X what if nuclei #s don't match between nucleus analysis and cluster analysis? [just loading data from nuclei that are in the table already]
- check manually that nuclei/cluster IDs match up
- some nuclei ordering seems alphabetical. Check it is kosher/ Re-order?
- QC on nuclei based on geometry/sphericity/deviation from the mean volume to weed out poorly segmented ones?
- Fiji: erase previous nuclei masks when performing a new cluster detection run. Or save folder under different name.
- add nuc_sphericity and other nuc geometry features to cluster table?
- compute modified z scores by egg chamber stages.
- addNucStatsToClustTable: use nucFullT instead of nucT.
- Check order of operations when merging cluster metrics into nuc table and vice versa.
- check for order of operations when merging cluster metrics and background correcting metrics. prob need to background correct everything first. Write one larger function that runs all those data processing steps in order to avoid issues: bg-correct nuclei, bg-correct clusters, merge clusters into nuc table, merge nuc data into cluster table. End up w 2 giant data tables.

- change "eggChamber" prefix in metrics computed across DAPI+ volume to avoid confusion.

*********************************
** Documentation:
- data org: add screen cap of folder architecture
- nuclei segmentation walk through.
- cluster detection walk through.

*********************************
** New functions:
- Histogram plot for nuclei metrics by egg chamber, by sample.
- plot metric a vs metric b. Use for z, egg chamber stage, sample.
- normalize metrics by z? By DAPI signal?
- add a checksum kind of function? E.g. plasmCorr vs subtraction of the plasm Int. (Are they supposed to be equal? Or is plasmCorr computed plane by plane?)
X loadNucleoliInt. Collect data from all files and append columns to t and fullT. Ignore neighbors, NumberOfVoxels, maybe Volume as well, load from the geometry file instead.
X LoadPlasmInt. Collect all files and move to t and fullT. Ignore neighbors, NumberOfVoxels, maybe Volume as well, load from the geometry file instead. 
- Method to correct nucleoli and plasmInt for wholeImgInt? Maybe include that in existing function.
X loadCluster. Generate new table. Generate a method to easily replicate nucleus metric to the format of the cluster table (i.e. replicate each nucleus metric as many times as there are clusters in the nucleus, for dimensions to match).
X load cluster geometry (sort of, just volume)
X streamline cluster table
X generate summary stats of clusters and add to nuclei table
- update the background correction method to apply to everything.

*********************************
** notes on analysis
- Judging by DAPI, median/wholeImgCorr seems the metric that gives the least CV. Not by a ton vs mean. The omg correction definitely helps though.
- unclear how EC stage, z impact metrics, need function to plot a vs b to figure that out.
- also maybe have a volume cutoff and/or DAPI std to be able to exclude poorly segmented nuclei if we think they will be an issue.
- prepare simple scripts for nucleus only analysis, cluster analysis, +/- egg chamber staging.
x why is the volume of plasm + nucleoli not equal to nucVolume? The delta is small (~1% of nuclei volume) but non zero. -> reduced the delta to < 1e-4 of the total volume by facing the morphology closing operation in Fiji. I'm guessing the closing can make the nucleoplasm slightly larger than the nucleus? Maybe need to be remarked at the end.

- build list of nuclei that are problemati

*********************************
** Fiji bugs
x nucleoliInt seems empty
X clusters quant only saved for nuc1???

*********************************
For the scatter by eggChamber function:
- use https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/inputparser.html to parse input.
Parameters: 
eggChamberStagesToInclude, 
samplesToInclude, 
colorCode (sample; eggChamber; condition; eggChamberStage; any variable really - check how to build the name intuitively. Maybe some keywords or full variable name), 
colorMap (include cBrewer options), 
alpha, 
addMeanAndErrorBar
Different grouping spacing modes?
Should I trim the data table as an easier way to process the data plotting?

*********************************
Data wrangling:
Build table joining every single metric
Add corrected intensity values. 
Nucleus/nucleolus/plasm metrics: correction by:
	- raw
	- wholeImg, 
	- eggChamber

Mean std median mode min max kurtosis skewness numVoxels Volume (10 metrics)
20 nuc geometry and status metrics
50 nuclei channel metrics
10 * 5 channels = 50 metrics for eggChamber
Same for wholeImg
Nucleoli = 50 channel metrics for nucleoli + 30 metrics for geometry
Plasm = 50 metrics for plasm + 30 metrics for geometry

70+ 100+ 160 = 330 metrics uncorrected. Without background correction, without clusters.
150 metrics are nuc/nucleolus/plasm channel variables, I.e. subject to bg correction.
180 remain. 180+ 150*3 = 630 for background corrected data.

Strategy: aggregate data in giant table
Ensure prefix/suffix system is rigorous for unambiguous naming.
nuc:
wholeImg
eggChamber -> "sampleROI" 
Plasm
Nucleoli
Cond
Sample
eggChamber
Clust
avgClust
stdClust

-> Change numClusters to nuc_NumClusters

Cluster:
Clust
Nuc
Plasm
Nucleoli

Suffix:
- raw
- plasmCorr (means from raw data, performed in Fiji)
- wholeImgSubtracted
- sampleROISubtracted
- plasmSubtracted
- nucleoliSubtracted

Channel string: C1 to C5
<prefix><channelString>_<metricName>_<suffix>

Change condIdx to cond_Idx
Same for sampleIdx, eggChamberID, eggChamberStage, nucLabel, clustLabel.

stdClustVolume

Prefix:
Nuc - wholeImg, sampleROI - min / median / mode?
Plasm - wholeImg, sampleROI - min / median / mode?
Nucleoli - wholeImg, sampleROI - min / median / mode?
WholeImg - --
sampleROI - -- 
Clust - plasm, nucleoli - wholeImg, sampleROI - min / median

Suffix:
Raw only

Clusters: subtraction by:
	- sampleROI 
	- wholeImg, 
	- eggChamber, 
	- nucleus, 
	- nucleolus, 
	- plasm.


****
sampleROI mode is an approximation of the levels within the egg chamber, outside of nuclei
wholeImgMode is an approximation of the background.

How to correct?
Intensity of nuclei. 
Intensity of egg chamber cytoplasm
